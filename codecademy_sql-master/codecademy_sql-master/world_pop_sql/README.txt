My SQL Practice Project From:

Codecademy Data Science course SQL basic level section
 
World Populations SQL Practice

Overview:
This project is slightly different than others encounter on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, 
this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project that needs to be built. 
There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of the requirements. 

Project Goals:
A dataset of world population by country data from recent years. 
Write queries to retrieve interesting data and answer a set of specific questions.

Project map:
codecademy_sql\world_pop_sql\db.sqlite			SQLite database 
codecademy_sql\world_pop_sql\population_queries.sql	SQL queries code line file 

Project:
2.
In this project, you’ll answer questions using a database of world population by country.

The schema of the database is:

Column	Type	Notes
country	STRING	
population	NUMBER	(in millions)
year	NUMBER	

Refer to this schema as you write queries to the database.

When you finish this project, you should be able to answer each the questions that follow using a single SQL query.

3.
The first query has already been written for you to answer the following question:

What years are covered by the dataset? (you can manually count the number of years returned).

Continue adding your queries below the first one as you proceed.

4.
What is the largest population size for Gabon in this dataset?

5.
What were the 10 lowest population countries in 2005?

6.
What are all the distinct countries with a population of over 100 million in the year 2010?

7.
How many countries in this dataset have the word “Islands” in their name?

8.
What is the difference in population between 2000 and 2010 in Indonesia?
