Predict Titanic Surviva
My Codecademy practice project from the Data Scientist Path Foundations of Machine Learning: Supervised Learning Course, Logistic Regression.

Project:
Predict which passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic using machine learning logistic regression models.

Pandas 
https://pandas.pydata.org/

Sklearn
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/

Numpy

Overview:

The RMS Titanic set sail on its maiden voyage in 1912, crossing the Atlantic from Southampton, England to New York City. 
The ship never completed the voyage, sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean after hitting an iceberg, bringing down 1,502 of 2,224 passengers onboard.

In this project I will create a Logistic Regression model that predicts which passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic based on age, sex and purchased ticket class.

The data I will be using for training our model is provided by Kaggle.
