Overview:

The National Parks Service would like you to perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species 
and to investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered.

Project:

Step 1
Import the modules that you'll be using in this assignment


Step 2
You have been given two CSV files. species_info.csv


Step 3
How many different species are in the species DataFrame?
What are the different values of conservation_status?

Step 4
Let's start doing some analysis!
let's create a bar charts!

Step 5
Conservationists have been recording sightings of different species at several national parks for the past 7 days. 
They've saved sent you their observations in a file called observations.csv
Let's start doing some analysis!
let's create a bar charts
