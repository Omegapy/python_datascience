Overview:

Newspapers and their online formats supply the public with the information we need to understand the events occurring in the world around us. 
From politics to sports, the news keeps us informed, in the loop, and ready to make decisions about how to act in a rapidly changing world.
Given the vast amount of news articles in circulation, identifying and organizing articles by topic is a useful activity. 
This can help you sift through the enormous amount of information out there so you can find the news relevant to your interests, or even allow you to build a news recommendation engine!
The News International is the largest English language newspaper in Pakistan, 
covering local and international news across a variety of sectors. A selection of articles from a Kaggle Dataset of The News International articles is provided in the workspace.

In this project I used term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) to analyze each article’s content and uncover the terms that best describe each article, 
providing quick insight into each article’s topic.
Prerequisites:

Using Jupyter Notebook as the project code presentation is a personal preference, not a project requirement.
